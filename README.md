Install instructions can be found at the bottom of this page. The DLC is required for this mod to funciton. This mod is not recommended for a first playthrough. **Manlea and Ninja skins should remain disabled if you are playing as a character other than Lea**. Mod only contains text for English.

### **Discord Server**

>**Note:** Additional addon mods created by me and others can be found on the Discord server.

# **Mod Content:**
1. Playable Triblader and Hexacast characters with all new combat arts (Hexacast is still WIP and currently 77% done)
2. Generic triblader party member
3. Updated Schneider/Luke movesets
4. New area in Bergen Village containing various maps and content
5. Triblader PVP arena cups available after beating Ku'lero Temple
6. Highly customizable practice arenas for triblader PVP duels
7. Support for ArcaneLab custom skills (more info below)

>**Note:** All mod content is optional and can be ignored in the main story. You can still play as Lea and just experience the modded content as her. The mod can also be loaded up on your existing save files if you want instant access to the duels and all the combat arts. It is also possible to fully complete the game as one of the modded characters. You can change characters at any time throughout the game as many times as you like. Skill tree, inventory, and progress will not be affected by changing characters.

## **How to Play:**
1. The entrance to the Rhombus Dungeon at the start of the game will have an option to divert to a place to select a character, after which you will continue to the Rhombus Dungeon and the rest of the game.
2. Regardless of whether you played the modded intro, characters can always be freely changed at the following locations:
   * Info Hub (Rookie Harbor)
   * Arena Lobby (Rhombus Square)
   * Mod Hideout (Bergen Village custom area)
3. New **party member** is available near the entrance to Bergen Trail. Their level and elements will be scaled properly regardless if you obtain them on a postgame save file or on a fresh playthrough.
4. Look for this new quest in Bergen Village to access the new area with bonus customizable pvp content

   * Required for mods that add extra characters
2. **cc-alybox:** https://github.com/lexisother/cc-alybox
   * Library mod needed for some features
3. **menu-ui-replacer:** https://github.com/CCDirectLink/cc-menu-ui-replacement/releases

### **Recommended Mods (optional - for enhanced party members)**
1. **cc-combat-art-level-extender:** https://github.com/CCDirectLink/cc-combat-art-level-extender  
   * Allows party members to use up to Lv.3 arts if you have mods that define higher-level arts for them. This will make your late-game Triblader party members use powerful attacks from XPC.  
2. **cc-party-element-effects:** https://github.com/XenonA7/cc-party-element-effects  
   * A small fix that makes party members show the "element swap" particle effect when they switch elements. This does not happen without the mod.



1. Back up your save files **\AppData\Local\CrossCode**


## Install CCLoader
CClaoder is a mod loader required to install mods on Crosscode.
Versions older than v2.21.0 will give an error with this mod.

1. Download CCloader from https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader/releases  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105614278/179910752-49fb02fd-87d4-43fb-8853-c1794925c223.png)
2. Extract the files  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105614278/179910853-0a511c33-a559-4e85-82ee-83e210ee3d83.png)
3. Locate these files from the extracted directory  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105614278/179910937-8c62ce97-f062-41c0-90b0-685c483e3de9.png)
4. Copy the files into your Crosscode game directory  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105614278/179911026-a895f1f7-7dfa-406a-8e94-8d4fc9e5bc62.png)
5. Launch the game to verify it is installed. You will see the CCLoader version in the bottom-right of the screen.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105614278/179911121-3f74421f-251a-462a-8172-aae6314d840f.png)

## Install Mods
1. Download and extract XTM and its dependencies, along with recommended mods if desired  
- (XTM Releases) https://github.com/XenonA7/xenons-triblader-mod/releases  
- (Required) extendable-severed-heads: https://github.com/CCDirectLink/extendable-severed-heads/releases  
- (Required) cc-alybox: https://github.com/lexisother/cc-alybox/releases
- (Required) menu-ui-replacer: https://github.com/CCDirectLink/cc-menu-ui-replacement/releases
- (Required) crosscode-extension-asset-preloader: https://github.com/elluminance/crosscode-extension-asset-preloader/releases
- (Recommended) cc-combat-art-level-extender: https://github.com/CCDirectLink/cc-combat-art-level-extender/releases  
- (Recommended) cc-party-element-effects: https://github.com/XenonA7/cc-party-element-effects/releases  

2. Place extracted mod folders inside **\CrossCode\assets\mods**  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105614278/179912844-b0ac6c4e-4a03-4a97-a3fc-22eb7d1a4bce.png)  

Note that if you click on any of these installed mods, there should be a file called **package.json** or **ccmod.json** directly inside those folders. If not, CCLoader won't be able to find the mods.

3. Launch the game. Go into the options menu and there will be a new tab with a hammer icon for mods (CCLoader adds this). It should look like this:  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105614278/179913184-8603fbe7-9cf6-4437-9ef7-e89b4930cb5c.png)  

If your mods don't appear here, make sure you don't have "folders inside folders". The mod folders need **package.json** or **ccmod.json** directly inside in order to be recognized.

If your mods appear in-game, you are good to go. Note that XTM is compatible with ArcaneLab and Autumn's Genesis and other mods. There is an old list of other Crosscode mods located here: https://c2dl.info/cc/mods

# How to Update to a New Version
1. Delete your old folder entirely.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105614278/180620611-e05635f6-16c4-406f-9689-7bbbed2d4cd5.png)  

2. Install the new version where the old one used to be  

* You can't just override the old version because if a new version removes old files or renames certain files then overriding will mess it up.

* All new versions of XTM are save-compatible with previous versions unless otherwise stated in the changelog.
