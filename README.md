>**Note:** Additional addon mods created by me and others can be found on the Discord server.

# **Mod Content:**
1. Playable Triblader and Hexacast characters with all new combat arts (Hexacast is only 77% done but still playable)
2. Generic Triblader party member
3. Updated Schneider/Luke movesets
4. New area in Bergen Village containing various maps and content
5. Triblader PVP arena cups available after beating Ku'lero Temple
6. Highly customizable practice arenas for triblader PVP duels
7. Support for ArcaneLab custom skills (more info below)

>**Note:** All mod content is optional and can be ignored in the main story. You can still play as Lea and just experience the modded content as her. The mod can also be loaded up on your existing save files if you want instant access to the duels and all the combat arts. It is also possible to fully complete the game as one of the modded characters. You can change characters at any time throughout the game as many times as you like. Skill tree, inventory, and progress will not be affected by changing characters.

## **How to Play:**
1. The entrance to the Rhombus Dungeon at the start of the game will have an option to divert to a place to select a character, after which you will continue to the Rhombus Dungeon and the rest of the game.
2. Regardless of whether you played the modded intro, characters can always be freely changed at the following locations:
   * Info Hub (Rookie Harbor)
   * Arena Lobby (Rhombus Square)
   * Mod Hideout (Bergen Village custom area)
3. New **party member** is available near the entrance to Bergen Trail. Their level and elements will be scaled properly regardless if you obtain them on a postgame save file or on a fresh playthrough.
4. Look for this new quest in Bergen Village to access the new area with bonus customizable pvp content

# Custom Skills
Custom Skills are a bonus feature that is only available if you have the **Arcane Lab** mod installed. Arcane Lab is optional, and custom skills won't be available within XPC if it is not installed. Custom skills allow characters to equip combat arts outside of the skill tree. This includes bonus combat arts, arts from other mods, and arts from other classes in XPC. It also allows you to change your default attacks to those of other classes.

Custom Skills can be accessed in the east room of the new Bergen Village area, along with more info about how to use and equip them.

## Written Install Instructions

2. Install the mod loader if this is your first time modding Crosscode.
   
    A. Download CCloader2 from https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader/releases
    >**Note:** Always download the latest version, the screenshot below is probably outdated.

    B. Extract the files.  
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105614278/179910853-0a511c33-a559-4e85-82ee-83e210ee3d83.png)

    C. Locate these files from the extracted directory.  
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105614278/179910937-8c62ce97-f062-41c0-90b0-685c483e3de9.png)

    D. Copy the files into your Crosscode game directory. Replace when asked.  
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105614278/179911026-a895f1f7-7dfa-406a-8e94-8d4fc9e5bc62.png)

    E. Launch the game to verify it is installed. You will see the CCLoader version in the bottom-right of the screen.  
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105614278/179911121-3f74421f-251a-462a-8172-aae6314d840f.png)

3. In the options menu, there is now a **"mods"** button at the top. This brings up the in-game mod manager.  
    <img width="826" height="447" alt="modButton" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e7f9420-e7b4-44d3-9c49-997d5be746c2" />

    Search for "Xenon's Playable Classes" and install it. The mod manager will automatically install all the dependency mods too.

    Now you're done! Just restart the game and you are good to go!
