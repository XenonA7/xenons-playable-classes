# XPC Technical Information
Thank you to Krypek, Azure Lazuline, Bakafish, Alyxia, and Lubkuluk for helping with some JS features.

## Misc JS Features
* Door entities will now hide their doormat (if the map style defines one) when their spawnCondition is false
* Adds new text icons including class logos (see \js\custom-font-icons.js)
* Adds the "default2" OneTimeSwitch type which has the default appearance but properly supports being hidden
* Adds the "forest-dng" map style
* Adds the "noHomingWhenAimingAtThis" config {} field option for generic proxies, will disable Hexacast homing while player is aiming at a proxy with this set to true

## PVP Features
* Speeds up the game when player dies in PVP but has party members remaining (can be disabled with tmp.speedUpBlock)
* Hides healthbars of defeated PVP enemies
* PVP scoreboard GUI element renders multiple head icons for larger teams
* For duels with multiple opponents, renders the enemy healthbars in a list rather than overlapping
* Party members will no longer eat consumables if they are in a PVP duel

## Modified Vanilla Action Steps
* ADD_ACTION_BUFF (new optional attribute "hasBuffTimer". If true, makes the yellow timer GUI functional assuming the action buff is granted by a simple proxy with a basic WAIT step following the ADD_ACTION_BUFF)

## Custom Action Steps
* DISABLE_HEALTHBAR (allows hiding the player health/status bar temporarily to enhance invisibility effects)
* DISABLE_SPIKEDMG (allows temporarily disabling the player's "pin body" modifier)
* COMBAT_ART_CHARGE_NOZOOM (identical to COMBAT_ART_CHARGE but does not zoom the camera)
* WAIT_WHILE_AIMING (adjust face towards cursor while waiting)
* RESET_GUARD_COMBO (resets all internal tracking of guard combo values)

## Custom Event Steps
* SET_PARTY_MEMBER_LEVEL_VAR (a copied version of SET_PARTY_MEMBER_LEVEL that accepts a NumberExpression for "level")

## Custom Combat Conditions
* TARGET_HAS_BLOCKED_DAMAGE
* TARGET_HAS_BLOCKED_HITS
